# sbc-train-controler

This is a set of Python programs that provide various behaviors for Train accessories
that are controlled by a Single Board Computer running Linux.  The initial implementaiton 
was developed and tested on the Beagle Bone White sbc, and now is targeted at Raspberry Pi 3.

We will start with a separate branch for rPi, and try to merge the code into a single library
that works on both boards if possible.

This program makes use of GPIO python function calls provided by an installed python library.

Requirements Document provides info on the features and modes

Example files and other documents will be added here to explain the code.
